# 🧾 Business Permits – Full Data Science Workflow  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This repository presents a **complete end-to-end data-science project** built on the Business Permits dataset. It covers the full analytical pipeline — from raw data cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine-learning modeling, and final packaging for deployment.
## 📂 Dataset Access
Due to GitHub’s 25 MB upload restriction, the full cleaned dataset is hosted externally on Dropbox.  
You can download it using the link below:  

🔗 [Download Retail_Sales_and_Retail_Use_Business_Registrations.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/445i27ran7oy2vre127n3/Retail_Sales_and_Retail_Use_Business_Registrations.csv?rlkey=n9lcf85u0huj9ja0qn49iay40&dl=1)
> The dataset contains business permit, retail sales, and registration data used for cleaning, EDA, and machine learning workflow development.

## 🧹 Step-by-Step Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Removed duplicates and missing values  
   - Standardized column names and formats  
   - Fixed inconsistent data entries  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualized numerical and categorical trends  
   - Created grouped summaries and correlation heatmaps  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Derived new ratio-based and time-based features  
   - Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical data  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
   - Trained regression and classification models  
   - Compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting  
   - Evaluated using MSE, R², Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  

5. **Model Validation & Packaging:**  
   - Validated model predictions  
   - Saved trained models using `joblib`  
   - Prepared full package (data, models, reports, notebook) for GitHub & Streamlit deployment
